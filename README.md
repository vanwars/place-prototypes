* [Data](https://vanwars.github.io/place-prototypes/cards/code.html)
* [Map](https://vanwars.github.io/place-prototypes/cards/map.html)
* [Cards](https://vanwars.github.io/place-prototypes/cards/index.html)
* [Table](https://vanwars.github.io/place-prototypes/cards/table.html)
* Quant data [NYTimes](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/blob/master/us-states.csv)
